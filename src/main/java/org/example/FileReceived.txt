# 说明

implement a reliable transport protocol called STP (Simple Transport Protocol) in Java. STP is designed to provide a byte-stream abstraction, like TCP, and sends pipelined data segments using a sliding window. Unlike TCP, STP does not implement congestion control or flow control. It also features an asymmetric design, with two distinct STP endpoints: the "sender" and the "receiver". Data packets flow from the sender to the receiver, while acknowledgements flow in the reverse direction.

To initiate the sender, use the following command:

```
java Sender sender_port receiver_port FileToSend.txt max_win rto
```

To initiate the receiver, use the following command:

```
java Receiver receiver_port sender_port FileReceived.txt flp rlp
```

Here's an overview of the project requirements:

1. Establish a connection using a two-way handshake (SYN, ACK).
2. Choose a random initial sequence number (ISN) and perform sequence number arithmetic modulo 2^16.
3. Implement a one-directional
